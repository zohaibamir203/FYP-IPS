## About The Project

This app consist of Indoor Positioning System which helps user to navigate customers to their desired stores inside mall and keep them updated regarding all mall shops sales. It helps mall managment to assign shop to a person and unassign when needed. Mall Shopkeepers can keep their customers updated regarding their offerings.
Indoor Positioning system use Digital Image Processing and Artificial Intelligence to find shortest path to the shop from customer location.
Their are many similar Application in Market but how our app is different:
* Our App don't use any Hardware to track customer and completely depends upon our AI code. 
* It reduce the cost of deployment of a system as mall owners don't need to install multiple wifi tracking points at few meters to track the position of customer. Mall Management only needs to pay software cost, Server cost which he also need to pay in other Applications which use hardware.
* Cost of mainitainance decreases as no hardware is installed.
